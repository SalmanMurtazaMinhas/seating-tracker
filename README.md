# **Seating Chart Manager**

A lightweight, browser-based seating arrangement tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows instructors to visually manage classroom seating, save multiple seating charts, switch between classes, and auto-save changes — all stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`.

This app includes a clean grid-based layout, a top control menu, and smooth toast notifications for user feedback.

## **🚀 How It Works**

### **1. Seating Grid**

Each seat is an `<input>` with a `data-id` such as `"2-14"` that uniquely identifies its location.
Values are stored in `localStorage` under the currently selected class.

### **2. Class Controls**

The top menu contains:

* **Class Selector** – choose from saved classes
* **Class Name Input** – name/rename the class
* **Save Class** – save or update the current layout
* **New Class** – clear the grid and prepare a fresh layout
* **Delete Class** – remove the selected class entirely

### **3. Storage Structure**

All classes are stored in:

```
localStorage["gridAllClasses"] = {
    "Class Name": {
        "1-1": "Student A",
        "1-2": "Student B",
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

Everything is stored locally — no backend required.

## **💾 Data Persistence**

All seating charts are saved in the browser’s `localStorage`.
This means:

* Data stays even if you refresh the page
* Data stays even if you close and reopen the browser
* Data is unique per device/browser

## **🛠 Technology Used**

* **HTML** – Structure & layout
* **CSS** – Grid layout, menu styling, toast animations
* **JavaScript** – Class management, auto-saving, UI logic
